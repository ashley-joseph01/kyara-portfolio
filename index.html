                <p>The world of cinematography has always fascinated me. The first time I held a camera, I knew that’s what I wanted to do, not because it looked pretty or because I could create something new. I liked working with the camera because I was directly making the director's vision a reality. I was crafting something from scratch, and the look on the director’s face when you’re able to create exactly what they wanted; it’s gratifying and reassuring to know that you’re able to do exactly what you were sought out for. </p>
                <br>
                <p>There’s this part of me that craves to know more about cinematography. It’s why I strive to learn from those who have experienced more than I have. I wish to be the best that I can be, so I can use all the tools available to me to create something beautiful. I desire improvement in my work, so I always seek out new opportunities to learn. Even if those opportunities do not lead me directly where I want to be, I know that eventually all that I’ve learned will aid me in becoming a better cinematographer. I do not want this to be as far as I go in life with this gift of creation we all have. I want to go further and be the best I can be.</p>
